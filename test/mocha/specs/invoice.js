  > Should include a panel that displays credit allocations.
    - When clicked a "new" button should allow the user to create a new minimalized version of cash receipt on-the-fly. The cash receipt need only record the amount, currency, document number, document date, distribution date and whether the balance should generate a credit memo or a customer deposit, depending on global customer deposit metrics.
    - When clicked, an "allocate" button should present a list of open receivables that are credits that can be associated with the invoice.
    - The 2 buttons above should only be enabled if the user has the "ApplyARMemos" privilege.

  > The customer search list should search only on active customers.

* A child workspace view should exist called XV.InvoiceLineWorkspace should include:
  > All the attributes on XM.InvoiceLine.

***** CHANGES MADE BY BILLING EXTENSION ******

* A model called XM.InvoiceRelation extending XM.Info should exist.
* XM.InvoiceRelation should include the following attributes:
  > String "number" that is the idAttribute
  > CustomerRelation "customer"
  > Date "invoiceDate"
  > Boolean "isPosted"

  > Boolean "isVoid"
* All users with the billing extension may read XV.InvoiceListItem.
* XM.InvoiceListItem is not editable.

* Add "Invoices" list to Billing module
* Add "Invoices" list to Sales modules

***** CHANGES MADE BY CRM EXTENSION ******

  > InvoiceIncident "incidents"
  > InvoiceOpportunity "opportunities"

***** CHANGES MADE BY SALES EXTENSION ******

* A nested only model should be created according to convention for many-to-many document associations:
  > XM.InvoiceSalesOrder

* XM.InvoiceLine will include:
  > SalesOrderLine "salesOrderLine"

* XM.InvoiceListItem will include:
  > String "orderNumber"

* XM.Invoice will include:
  > String "orderNumber"
  > Date "orderDate" default today
  > InvoiceSalesOrder "salesOrders"

    - The current_timestamp - authorization date is less than CCValidDays || 7
    - The payment status the cc payment (ccpay) record is authorized ("A")
    - The cc payment record is for an order number = the order number specified on the invoice
* When currency or invoice date is changed authorized credit should be recalculated.
* When freight is changed the total should be recalculated.

***** CHANGES MADE BY INVENTORY EXTENSION ******

  > There is no associated salesOrderLine (attr added by sales extension)

* XM.InvoiceListItem will include:
  > String "shipDate"
  > String "shipToName"
* XM.InvoiceListItem will extend the post function to include inventory information
  * For each line item where "updateInventory" is true, issue materials to the invoice
  * Capture distribution detail (trace and location) where applicable
#HINT: This will likely require creating an alternate dispatchable "post" function that accepts an invoice id _and_ inventory data.

* XM.Invoice will include:
  > Date "shipDate" default today
  > CustomerShiptoRelation "shipto"
  > String "shiptoName"
  > String "shiptoAddress1"
  > String "shiptoAddress2"

    - shiptoName
    - shiptoAddress1
    - shiptoAddress2
    - shiptoAddress3
    - shiptoCity
    - shiptoState
    - shiptoPostalCode
    - shiptoCountry
    - shiptoPhone
* The inventory extension adds a function to XM.Invoice "copyBilltoToShipto" that does the following
  > Clears the shipto
  > Copies billto name, address fields and phone number to shipto equivilants.
  > Sets the invoice tax zone to the customer tax zone.
* When an invoice is loaded where "isPosted" is true, then the following attributes will be made read only:
  > lineItems
  > number
  > invoiceDate
  > terms
  > salesrep
  > commission
  > taxZone
  > shipCharges
  > project
  > freight
  > shipZone
  > saleType

* If the shipto changes to a value, the following fields should be set based on information from the shipto:
  - shiptoName (= customer.shipto.name)
  - shiptoAddress1
  - shiptoAddress2
  - shiptoAddress3
  - shiptoCity
  - shiptoState
  - shiptoPostalCode
  - shiptoCountry (< ^ should be populated by the default customer.shipto.address).
  - shiptoPhone
  - salesRep
  - commission
  - taxZone
  - shipCharge

* if the shipto is cleared these fields should be unset
  - shiptoName
  - shiptoAddress1
  - shiptoAddress2
  - shiptoAddress3
  - shiptoCity
  - shiptoState
  - shiptoPostalCode
  - shiptoCountry
  - shiptoPhone
* If any of the above listed shipto attributes are manually altered, the shipto is unset.

* Freight should be read only and zero when the "isCustomerPay" property is false on the ship charge associated with the invoice.

* totalTax should be recalculated when freight changes.

* Add the following to the invoice workspace:
  > When the customer is changed on the XV.InvoiceWorkspace model:
    - customer should be set on shipto relation so that it will search on and select from that customer's shipto addresses.
    - The bill to address should be supplimented with a "Shipto" button that when clicked runs the copyToShipto function ()
    - The copy ship to button should be disabled if the customer does not allow free-form shiptos.
  > The shipto addresses available when searching addresses sholud filter on the addresses associated with the customer's account record by default.

***** CHANGES MADE BY PROJECT EXTENSION ******

* A nested only model should be created according to convention for many-to-many document associations:
  > XM.InvoiceProject

* XM.Invoice will include:
  > ProjectRelation "project"
  > InvoiceProject "projects"

* When an invoice is loaded where "isPosted" is true, then the following attributes will be made read only:
